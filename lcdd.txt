lcdd: (version 0.6ANSI) 8Apr2010

NAME:
        lcdd  -  Simple userspace daemon which acts as an ANSI driver for
                 HD44780 based char LCDs parallel connected to the
                 "LCD" port of the TS72x0 board.

SYNOPSIS:

        lcdd [-v] [-s LxCC] [-p delay] [-c delay] [named_pipe]

DESCRIPTION:

lcdd implements a simple userspace daemon that acts as a driver for
HD44780 character based LCD modules attached to a Technologics TS72x0
SBC via the "LCD" interface.

This version supports a subset of the ANSI terminal control sequences.

lcdd creates, opens and reads a named pipe (by default /dev/lcd),
initialises the lcd device, and sits a loop waiting for data on the
named pipe and writing it to the lcd device.

By default the size of the lcd is assumed to be 2 rows of 16 characters.
This can be changed by using the "-s" option.

Command line options & Flags:

 -v       verbose output, also prevents the program from detaching from 
          console and backgrounding. This is useful when debugging.
          the verbose output and any errors are output to stderr.

 -s LxCC  set the size of the lcd to L rows each of CC characters
          the default is 2x16

 -c delay set the pause between chars of output to "delay" tenths of a 
          second. e.g. -c 10   for a 1 second delay between chars

 -p delay set the pause between lines of output to "delay" tenths of a 
          second. e.g. -p 10   for a 1 second delay

ANSI SUPPORT:

The following ANSI commands are supported:

   ESC D   Scroll Down
   ESC M   Scroll Up

   ESC c   reset device

   ESC [ n A  cursor up    n times (default 1)
   ESC [ n B  cursor down  n times (default 1)
   ESC [ n C  cursor right n times (default 1)
   ESC [ n D  cursor left  n times (default 1)

   ESC [ r ; c H  cursor position at row r, column c
                  (counting from 1 up) default is 1;1 - top left

   ESC [ n J  erase screen - n='0' erase to end of screen   (default)
                             n='1' erase to start of screen
			     n='2' erase all screen

   ESC [ n K  erase line   - n='0' erase to end of line     (default)
                             n='1' erase to start of line
			     n='2' erase all screen

   ESC [ s       save cursor position
   ESC [ u       restore cursor position

   ESC [ 7 h     enable line wrap
   ESC [ 7 l     disable line wrap

Non-standard Commands implemented:

   ESC [ X    underline cursor
   ESC [ Y    block cursor
   ESC [ Z    hide cursor

   ESC [ n E  set shift and display entry mode 
		4  Left Reverse
		5  Right Reverse
		6  Right Normal
                7  Left Normal

	      This is sent as a direct lcd command to the lcd device
	      see HD44780 documentation.

   ESC [ c ; l w  set delay between characters to c tenths of a second
                  set delay between lines to l tenths of a second
                  e.g. to just set a delay between characters of 0.1 sec
                       ESC [ 1 ; 0 w
                       to just set a delay between lines of 0.5 sec
                       ESC [ 0 ; 5 w
 
BUGS:

Of course! This is beta s/w knocked together in my free time (precious
little). 

Not enough diagnostics.

Let me know if you use this software.  Any bugs, questions,
suggestions or problems, etc. should be sent to
